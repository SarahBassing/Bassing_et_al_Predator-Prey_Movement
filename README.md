This repository archives the code used for analyses described in the manuscript. Data already formatted for resource selection and movement analyses are archived with Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kh1893292. Raw data (coordinates of GPS-collar relocations) are considered sensitive and not publicly available.
